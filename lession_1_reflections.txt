How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff will help in viewing the lines which are different. It will not be able to pinpoint the location of the difference for you.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By having easy access to the entire history of a file it possible to view all changes made in the past by different users.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: The developer will have the flexibility to choose his save point.
    cons: Since it is automatically saved you may not get the exact location where the bug is.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it helps you track changes of the files which are logically connected.
    
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log helps you add comments to your commits to review later and git diff gives information about the no of modifications.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git version control points the exact line where changes had been done and this gives the confidence to make changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to start coding with the help of git.
